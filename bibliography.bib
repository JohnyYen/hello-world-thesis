	abstractNote={In the face of the rapid evolution of the gaming market and the puzzling overlap of genres, consistency in classification seems elusive. The purpose of the present review was to explore the classification of video game genres in the context of psychological research. The aim was to address the challenges associated with creating consistent and meaningful classifications of video game genres, considering the rapid evolution of the gaming market and recent tendency to create games that could be classified into multiple genres. We performed a search in four databases according to the PRISMA guidelines and reviewed 96 full-text papers (N = 49 909). Through our findings, we reveal how researchers strive to classify genres and the numerous complications that arise from this pursuit. In the face of these challenges, we propose alternative ways of classifying genres. Our first proposal is a new classification of video game genres based on our literature review. In our second proposal, we advocate a more detailed understanding by focusing on specific gaming mechanics, and thus we introduce the innovative concept of utilizing community-based tags, such as Steam tags, as an alternative to genres in psychological research.}, number={6}, journal={PLOS ONE}, author={Starosta, Jolanta and Kiszka, Patrycja and Szyszka, Paulina Daria and Starzec, Sylwia and Strojny, Paweł}, editor={Charland, Patrick}, year={2024}, month=june, pages={e0299819},

We observed that the 100 most ranked games are represented by 16 genres (adventure, role-playing, shooter, platform, puzzle, strategy, hack and slash / beat ’em up, real time strategy, turn-based strategy, point-and-click, indie, racing, sport, fighting, arcade and simulator). These genres are then compared to show which genres are more attractive for players. As a result, we observed that 6 genres among the 16 represent the most ranked games (adventure, RPG, shooter, platform, puzzle, and strategy). They represent 0.83 of the successful games. This allowed us to recommend to combining the others genres with the 6 selected genres. Also, we analyzed the evolution of the 16 games genres during the last 34 years. We observed that some genres have a great success until the past decades, but they haven’t a success in this decade. Game designers and researchers in the field of games may rethink about how to add attractive elements in the genres non-successful in this decade. Also, we observed that some genres like the indie games haven’t a great success in the past decades, but they have an important increased success in this decade. This may encourage the decision makers and the game designer to invest on these genres.}, number={15}, journal={International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM)}, author={Qaffas, Alaa A.}, year={2020}, month=sept, pages={175}, language={en} }}

During last two decades, video games proved to be an interactive visual media able to incorporate virtual heritage in amazing and highly appealing ways. At the same time, each video game represents a valuable artifact reflecting technological, socioeconomic and historical issues of its creation. Therefore, video games are an essential and integrated part of modern cultural heritage and themselves need preservation efforts. The present paper discusses video games as a modern tool for presenting cultural heritage by integrating art, storytelling and digital technology. It focuses on both entertainment games and serious games for cultural heritage and provides some illustrative examples of such games with discussing their approach and novelty. On the other hand, video games are viewed as interactive artifacts that are a valuable part of the modern cultural heritage, which requires specific efforts for their preservation together with technological platforms and gaming environment.},

	title = {A Games First Approach to Teaching Introductory Programming},
	abstract = {In this paper we argue for using a “Game First” approach to teaching introductory programming. We believe that concerns over whether an {OO} approach or a procedural approach should be used first are secondary to the course assignment and example content. If examples are not compelling, student interest often lags thus making the {OO} versus procedural argument moot. We believe that game programming motivates most new programmers. Compelling assignments mean that students are far more likely to learn because they are interested, and the visual component allows students to see mistakes in their code as manifested in the resultant graphics. We describe our experiences after redesigning and offering a new introductory computer science sequence using 2D game development as a unifying theme. We teach fundamental programming concepts via two dimensional game development in Flash and {ActionScript} during the first quarter, transition to C++ to solidify concepts and add pointers during the second quarter, then teach a multi-phase project based game approach using C++ and {openGL} (2D graphics only) during the third quarter. Our surveys show that this approach improved student understanding of all seven basic topics examined.},

In this sense, open {EGs} could facilitate reuse and adaptation, once they follow the openness principles. This paper provides a systematic review of Open Educational Games ({OEG}) designed specifically for teaching computer programming and computational logic. It has been identified that most authors find the issue of reusing and adapting {EGs} following the openness philosophy as very important, but even them fail to use open tools in game development. We conclude that most articles recommend using component-based development, reuse and adaptation, but reuse still does not happen in a practical sense. Also, the amount of studies on {EGs} for teaching programming is low in the scientific literature, and most open {EGs} available on the Internet are not documented nor have some associated published paper. Thus, reuse and adaptation may even occur, but without scientific documentation and publication.},

	abstract = {The idea of Gamification is very popular for applying the gaming concept theory in various fields. Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: “which game elements should be applied to student activities?”. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students’ performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from {UNEP} and {DHI} centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the “Non-Gamified” and the “Gamified” groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica. Academic indicators and numerical indicators were used to directly measure the effect and behavioral outcome of the use of game elements. Finally, the study suggested that leaderboards could improve the overall performance of students so it can be worth implementing it in classroom activities.},

According to the inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria, it was determined to include 9 {SLR} articles on gamification that address at least one of the two key variables: student motivation or academic performance. The articles were published between 2016 and 2022, available in open access, written in English or Spanish, and with content that is directly related to the research questions. The results reveal that gamification significantly influences motivation by facilitating the assimilation of knowledge, the improvement of skills and academic competencies of students, and specifically refers to a wide range of capabilities that are essential for success in the educational environment and that can be enhanced through playful and interactive learning experiences. These skills can be cognitive, self-learning, social, or collaborative, among others.

Studies have broadly investigated the role of coding games in supporting CT learning in formal classroom contexts, but there has been limited exploration of their use in informal home-based settings. This study investigated the factors that motivated students to use a coding game called Coding Galaxy in a home-based setting. It explored the connections between the students’ perceptions of and usage of the tool. An 11-day intervention was conducted at a primary school in Hong Kong with 104 participants. The students’ perceptions of the game were collected via questionnaires and information on their use of the tool was extracted from log files. Results indicated that coding motivation and feeling of enjoyment were predictors of the actual use of the game, with coding motivation the dominant factor. Focus group interviews were also conducted to further explore the students’ motivation to play the game. Through comparisons of active and inactive users, the qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, indicating that students who were more intrinsically motivated tended to be more active in using the game. The implications of the study for researchers and practitioners in CT education are discussed.}, number={1}, journal={Education and Information Technologies}, author={Zhang, Shuhan and Wong, Gary K.

Despite an abundance of empirical studies on the relationship between digital educational games and student’s motivation for learning, a consensus has yet to be reached. This study aims to bridge existing research gaps by adopting a mixed-methods approach grounded in behaviorist learning theory and contextual cognitive theory. A detailed questionnaire was disseminated to students from three distinct university in Thailand. After the exclusion of invalid responses, a robust sample of 434 valid responses was curated and utilized for analysis. Utilizing SPSS and MPLUS software, empirical analyses were conducted to explore the impact of digital educational games on student’s motivation for learning. Research results indicate that: First, digital educational games positively influence student’s motivation for learning; Second, learning engagement serves as a mediator between digital educational games and student’s motivation for learning; Third, the digital environment moderates the relationship between digital educational games and student’s learning engagement. Notably, the positive impact of digital educational games on student learning engagement is amplified in a more immersive digital environment. This study contributes to behaviorist theory and social cognition theory by elucidating how digital educational games affect student’s motivation for learning through their engagement and by highlighting the moderating role of the digital environment. Practically, these findings underscore the significance of digital educational games and the digital environments in schools to enhance student’s motivation for learning.}, number={1}, journal={PLOS ONE}, author={Li, Youling and Chen, Di and Deng, Xinxia}, editor={Gutiérrez-Pérez, José}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={e0294350}, language={en} }}}

			Game-based learning is a methodology that has gained importance in the world of education due to the benefits of implementing ICT in the classroom. Due to the intellectual and competence demands that some commercial video games promote, they can be very valuable tools to stimulate and promote metacognitive abilities in students. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze the use of commercial video games in educational contexts and their impact on the development of metacognitive skills.
		
		
			Methods
			For the analysis of the study, a systematic review of the literature was carried out following the PRISMA statement. Specialized databases such as Scopus, WoS, PsyInfo, PubMed, SciELO, and Eric were consulted, which helped capture the essence of the problem between 2004 and 2024.
		
		
			Results
			The review was then carried out on 10 selected articles. The results obtained show the following evidence: (a) commercial video games, together with the use of metacognitive strategies, enrich academic and social aspects as well as the metacognitive level, and (b) commercial video games are as effective in promoting metacognition as other more traditional methodologies or tools.
		
		
			Discussion
			Finally, there is a need to rethink the implications of the use of video games in the classroom if we want students to acquire skills that will be essential to successfully respond to the demands and challenges of their academic and professional future.}, journal={Frontiers in Education}, author={Checa-Romero, Mirian and Gimenez-Lozano, José Miguel}, year={2025}, month=jan, pages={1485098}, language={en} }}

Children spend 25–50% of their daytime in school and risks of school accidents are high. The purpose of this study is to perform a comprehensive analysis of game-related injuries.
Methods: A nationwide dataset of 36,002 school injury events that occurred in Israel between 2013 and 2019 and were served by the National EMS, was used. The relations between different variables were demonstrated using multidimensional frequency tables. Z-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA tests, and J48 classification trees were used to analyze the data.
Results: The prevailing injury cause (36.8%) was “game”, 44.8% of which occur during breaks, and the most frequently injured body regions were head, hand, and leg/foot (47.2%, 26.7%, and 19.7%, respectively). Age was negatively correlated with head injuries and positively correlated with limb injuries. 33% of all injuries occur in the playground and 20.1% occur in the sports field. About 33.3% of game-related injuries in elementary schools occur during the 10:00 a.m. break and an additional 24.7% during the 12:00 p.m. lunch break.
Conclusion: Games are the prevailing cause of school injuries in Israel. Gender and age differences, and seasonal and circadian trends were observed. Understanding the patterns and the trends of school injuries can enable the development of effective prevention policies on the national, municipal, and local levels, focusing the efforts on the key factors affecting injury incidence. Efficient use of resources is necessary, taking into account resource and budget constraints. Efforts can include education of teachers and pupils in relation to school accidents, promoting a safer physical environment, safety education, staff development and family and community involvement, and coordinative training with a focus on proprioception.}, number={1}, journal={Israel Journal of Health Policy Research}, author={Jaffe, Eli and Khalemsky, Anna and Khalemsky, Michael}, year={2021}, month=dec, pages={51}, language={en} }}

These premises have led to a growing body of research on game-based learning (GBL) as a pedagogical advance in both formal and informal education. Even though GBL has many potential benefits, some challenges need to be taken into account while developing and implementing GBL. In this context, the goal of this study is to accomplish two goals: (a) map the primary barriers encountered when applying GBL approaches in educational settings; and (b) provide an intervention diagram that links each kind of barrier with potential strategies to overcome it. To achieve these aims, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out using the PRISMA criteria and methodology. This includes procedures for eligibility and screening that were based on inclusion criteria that were established with the goals of the research. The analysis of the articles obtained for the systematic review reveals four different types of barriers to more regular GBL implementations. These barriers include (1) behavioural and attitudinal barriers; (2) school policy barriers; (3) material and technology barriers; and (4) barriers related to game literacy. Based on these barriers, we propose certain methodological strategies that might help practitioners get beyond the identified barriers. The strategies include: (a) adopting a participatory-driven and co-creation approach; (b) carefully considering whether to use digital, analogue, or hybrid games; (c) using a range of educational actors in the process; and (d) pushing for GBL training in projects. It is possible to argue that attitudinal barriers are related to the other barriers that have been discussed. For example, material barriers affect teachers’ belief that there are currently not enough suitable educational games. Although policy makers’ attitudes can be examined as a part of the macro-level attitudinal barriers, the effectiveness of their measures in the daily educational context is influenced by a separate set of barriers, which will now be investigated. Assessment literacy in GBL refers to teachers’ beliefs about adopting games and how these affect students’ motivation and cognitive development and is similar to an attitudinal aspect. In line with this result, it can be stated the potential strategies are also interrelated. Co-creative processes can be enhanced by integrating a multi-stakeholder approach to GBL, where finalized entertainment works successfully reflect the experiences of all participants. This article corroborates, evaluates, and groups the intervention streams as the basis of a comprehensive program of intervention where existing scientific literature on studies of GBL interventions naturally suggests the solutions.}, number={10}, journal={Electronic Journal of e-Learning}, author={Yaman, Havva and Sousa, Carla and Neves, Pedro Pinto and Luz, Filipe}, year={2025}, month=jan, pages={19–36}, language={en} }}

	abstract = {Problem-based learning ({PBL}) is a didactic strategy oriented to the competency-based approach within constructivist theories. {PBL} generates a collaborative learning process in the student, as well as self-learning and meaningful learning from a contextualized problem situation. This methodology arises to support the process of pedagogical change that occurs under the competency-based approach in higher education in order to generate active learning in students. In this paper, a five-phase methodology was developed (identification of the problem situation, organization of the work for collaborative learning, monitoring and support for self-learning, construction of applied solutions, and evaluations and feedback) to apply {PBL} in the Supply Chain Management course of the Industrial Engineering Program at Corporación Universitaria del Caribe ({CECAR}). A systematic literature review was carried out to identify the low application rate of the methodology in the field of industrial engineering. For the application of the strategy, three contextualized problems were taken as a basis, which are associated with companies of the economic sectors that have the highest influence in the generation of the Gross Domestic Product ({GDP}) of the region. The academic impact on a total of four groups was evaluated. Additionally, the expected competences, performances, and products in the courses were achieved, thus obtaining a great acceptance and efficiency in {PBL} application.},

Notwithstanding its adoption in undergraduate and graduate medical education, its usefulness remains a topic of debate. This study aims to review current worldwide data on the efficacy and utility of critical thinking and clinical skills using PBL educational methods for teaching programs to undergraduate medical students, ursing students, dental students and medical residents.
Methods The search was conducted in June 2024 in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science and included all publications regardless of the publication date, study design, or country of origin.
Results Thirteen meta-analyses and systematic reviews were compiled through database screening. The results showed that PBL effectively enhanced students’ clinical skills and critical thinking abilities; nevertheless, further evidence is needed to confirm this finding.
Conclusion PBL may be a successful and an effective instructional strategy, not only medical, but also nursing and dental education. Students can learn skills and acquire competencies useful for their medical professionalism through PBL in addition to their existing knowledge.}, number={1}, journal={BMC Medical Education}, author={Ge, Wei-Li and Zhu, Xia-Yin and Lin, Jiang-Bo and Jiang, Jian-Jun and Li, Tao and Lu, Yi-Fei and Mi, Ya-Fei and Tung, Tao-Hsin}, year={2025}, month=mar, pages={455}, language={en} }}

With the development of information technology, collaborative problem-solving in online environments has received increasing attention in recent years. There has been some foundation of research on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and collaborative problem-solving (CPS). They both have a focus, but there is a trend to combine them. Further understanding of the current state of research on online collaborative problem-solving is much needed. This study reviews 528 relevant papers from the last decade. The researchers summarized the current state of research and hotspots in online collaborative problem-solving based on the visual analysis of CiteSpace. It was found that the number of papers on online collaborative problem-solving is on the rise, with CPS and CSCL as the main research content and ‘feature extraction’, ‘task analysis’, and ‘computation modeling’ as the hot research topics in the past three years. The current research power on CPS and CSCL is mainly distributed in China and the United States, but the inter-institutional collaboration is little. Based on the research results, this paper proposes four future directions to improve the research in online collaborative problem-solving: identity awareness in online collaborative problem-solving, interdisciplinary online collaborative problem-solving, online collaborative problem-solving for teachers, and online collaborative problem-solving and ICT skills.}, number={10}, journal={Mathematics}, author={Jiang, Peijie and Ruan, Xiaomeng and Feng, Zirong and Jiang, Yanyun and Xiong, Bin}, year={2023}, month=may, pages={2353}, language={en} }}

The results show that the PBL teaching model effectively improves Chinese undergraduate students’ achievement and critical thinking, and therefore, PBL can be implemented in Chinese undergraduate education. However, the use of the PBL teaching model is narrow due to its late start in China, and a more rigorous methodology and mixed-methods design of the studies are needed to improve the transferability of the results.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice}, author={Lu, Yuxin and Singh, Charanjit Kaur Swaran}, year={2024}, month=feb, language={en} }}

 @article{Admiraal, title={The concept of flow in collaborative game-based learning}, abstractNote={Generally, high-school students have been characterized as bored and disengaged from the learning process. However, certain educational designs promote excitement and engagement. Game-based learning is assumed to be such a design. In this study, the concept of ﬂow is used as a framework to investigate student engagement in the process of gaming and to explain effects on game performance and student learning outcome. Frequency 1550, a game about medieval Amsterdam merging digital and urban play spaces, has been examined as an exemplar of game-based learning. This 1-day game was played in teams by 216 students of three schools for secondary education in Amsterdam. Generally, these students show ﬂow with their game activities, although they were distracted by solving problems in technology and navigation. Flow was shown to have an effect on their game performance, but not on their learning outcome. Distractive activities and being occupied with competition between teams did show an effect on the learning outcome of students: the fewer students were distracted from the game and the more they were engaged in group competition, the more students learned about the medieval history of Amsterdam. Consequences for the design of game-based learning in secondary education are discussed.}, author={Admiraal, Wilfried}, language={en} }}

However, due to the high variety of the conducted studies and the lack of secondary studies (e.g., systematic literature reviews) in this field, it is difficult to get the state-of-the-art of this research domain. To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify i) which gamification design methods have been used in the studies about gamification and Flow Theory, ii) which gamification elements have been used in these studies, iii) which methods have been used to evaluate the users’ flow experience in gamified settings, and iv) how gamification affects users’ flow experience. The main results show that there is growing interest to this field, as the number of publications is increasing. The most significant interest is in the area of gamification in education. However, there is no unanimity regarding the preferred method of the study or the effects of gamification on users’ experience. Our results highlight the importance of conducting new experimental studies investigating how gamification affects the users’ flow experience in different gamified settings, applications and domains.}, note={arXiv:2106.09942 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2106.09942}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Oliveira, Wilk and Pastushenko, Olena and Rodrigues, Luiz and Toda, Armando M. and Palomino, Paula T. and Hamari, Juho and Isotani, Seiji}, year={2021}, month=june, language={en} }}

Significant evidence of transfer was found to overall cognition, as well as to attention/perception and higher-order cognition constructs. Examination of specific gameplay features however showed selective and differential transfer to these outcome measures, whereas the genre labels of “action”, “strategy”, “casual”, and “non-casual” were not similarly predictive of outcomes. We therefore recommend that future video-game interventions targeting cognitive enhancements should consider gameplay feature classification approach over existing genre classification, which may provide more fruitful training-related benefits to cognition.},

	abstract = {This research highlights the importance of computer programming in higher education, given the high demand of the software industry. However, developing this skill is challenging due to the need for competencies in logic, mathematics, and problem solving. The University of the Amazon faces high levels of failure in the subject of Logic and Algorithms I, which leads to an increase in student retention rates and can influence the efficiency of educational quality. The study was approached from a qualitative approach, since it focused on understanding the causes of student failure in the previously mentioned subject of the institution's systems engineering program. Likewise, the scope is exploratory, based on a documentary and descriptive review through the interview which allowed us to know the opinions of the respondents. According to the research, it is concluded that there are aspects other than academic ones that are associated with failing the subject, such as emotional and family problems, prior knowledge and motivation.},

The article highlights the results of the research conducted by teachers and students of these universities. In this research, teachers with no previous experience in this field or specialized {IT} skills created educational games. Free software tools that can be used to create educational games were selected for this research (Construct 3, {GameMaker} Studio 2, Unity, Godot Engine, Unreal Engine 4). The study included two data arrays: the first was the opinion expressed by teachers who developed educational games, and the second – that of students who tested the final game product. We analyzed free tools for creating educational games according to such criteria: the need for programming language knowledge, availability of support forums and reference materials, ability to export data to multiple platforms and in many formats, add in-app purchases or various components to each object, whether both 2D and 3D games are supported, development speed. In the Ukrainian teachers’ opinion, {GameMaker} Studio 2 was the most effective, while teachers in Turkey and Bulgaria preferred the Unreal Engine 4. According to research results, it is worth noting a high interest of both teachers and students in the creation and use of educational computer games. It should also be noted that these results are relevant only for specific groups under study since they are based on the individual experience of a limited number of students. However, they are significant for shaping ideas about pedagogical strategies and allow teachers to learn new information, try new types of activities and interaction.},

This permeability allows the study of the cultural aspects surrounding the production and use of video games as tools for cultural dissemination. Our research enunciates, recognises, analyses and evaluates the impact of these tools with the aim of being taken into consideration by the scientiﬁc community and the general population, who most frequently consume, use and socialise through video games around the world. Based on this, a systematic literature review ({SLR}) was carried out using the Prisma 2020 Protocol, using the {WOS} and {SCOPUS} databases as documentary sources, and the selection of research articles that explore the cultural aspects of video games according to pre-established criteria. The ﬁnal sample (N = 45) was subjected to a study that posed 12 research questions around which this work is structured. As a result, it is evident that video games have a direct impact on the transmission of culture. Patterns and agents of cultural representation, transmission and communication were identiﬁed, allowing researchers to evaluate the impact of video games on culture and to approach this object of study from an academic perspective, helping to open up other lines of research related to the inﬂuence of video games on the assimilation of culture, the learning of relevant issues related to it or the transmission of speciﬁc cultural elements.},

Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic interest in {EVGs} little research has been devoted to delve into teacher’s beliefs affecting their attitude towards {EVGs} and how these beliefs also affect their intention to use {EVGs} in their courses. Using Keller’s {ARCS} model as a theoretical framework, the role of perceived relevance and attention in teachers’ attitude and intention to use {EVGs} is analyzed. To do so a research model is tested using a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers via structural equation modeling to predict teachers’ attitude and behavioral intention to use {EVGs} in their courses. Results suggest that perceived attention drawn by {EVGs} is a factor affecting teachers’ intentions to use {EVGs} in their courses. Perceived relevance was not found to affect directly neither attitude nor intention to use while teachers’ perceived attention was found to affect teachers’ perceived relevance of {EVGs}.

To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify i) which gamification design methods have been used in the studies about gamification and Flow Theory, ii) which gamification elements have been used in these studies, iii) which methods have been used to evaluate the users’ flow experience in gamified settings, and iv) how gamification affects users’ flow experience. The main results show that there is growing interest to this field, as the number of publications is increasing. The most significant interest is in the area of gamification in education. However, there is no unanimity regarding the preferred method of the study or the effects of gamification on users’ experience. Our results highlight the importance of conducting new experimental studies investigating how gamification affects the users’ flow experience in different gamified settings, applications and domains.},

This new scenario has changed the interests of students. Therefore, teachers need to explore new strategies and resources to increase the motivation and engagement of the students. The aim of this paper is to review the benefits of the use of gamification and its application in education. Several academic publications between 2011 and 2016 regarding to the use of gamification, motivation and immersion, have been examined. The choice of this period of time has been made in order to offer a review of the evolution and development of gamification during those five years. According to Werbach and Hunter (2012), it is necessary to study the game dynamics, mechanics and components under a qualitative methodology based on the analysis of the content. Results show that gamification processes in education generate important benefits to the students, not without some difficulties. The article concludes in support of the benefits of the use of gamification in education, such as motivation, immersion in order to plan new situations and anticipate them, the engagement and the sociability through interaction and interactivity, as well as the great number of different elements involved in the process, which make education more motivating and engaging for students.},

This paper deals mainly with defining the programming knowledge and common problems with teaching programming, comparing the properties of novice and experts programmers and introducing the semantic method of teaching programming where one would teach only the semantics of programming constructs unbound to specific programming language in an interactive motivating setting of educational computer game. In this paper we discuss the main characteristics of computer games and specific features which makes them useful in the educational setting. As an example of presented method we introduce a game on the presentation of variables in programming. The game is based on visualizations of different types of variables and on the interpretation of the assignment sentence. The game actively encourages interactivity and deeper learning.},

The strategy of this argument will be to expand on the paper written by Eric Sheng in which he stresses his concerns on the immoral playthrough of the player. This expansion of Sheng’s argument will shed light on the different ways in which we play video games and that the same acts do not have to have the same moral problems. Therefore, the constructivist procedure will be used as a way to determine an answer to the question of the individual motivation behind a virtual act and show the moral implications of it.

Further, the study wanted to explore student perceptions of Prodigy. The study was conducted in two fifth grade classrooms with a total of 31 participants. Two mathematics units were utilized to compare; one on multiplying whole numbers and the other on dividing whole numbers. In addition, participants completed a survey and a focus group interview to find out participant perceptions of Prodigy. Results reveal that the whole group scored higher in Prodigy (M=9.581, {SD}=4.048) compared to no Prodigy (M=5.419, {SD}=3.871). Similar results were reported in each of the subgroups. The same results were reported for each of the subgroups. The scores for Prodigy program are higher than no Prodigy. For the survey, participants showed an overall as well as within each subgroup positive view of Prodigy, with 112 Agree and Strongly Agree responses compared to 9 Disagree and Strongly Disagree responses. Almost all subgroups, especially by ethnicity, reported that they like and feel the Prodigy program helped them learn math better and enjoy using it in class.

	abstract = {When the traditional "one size fits all" approach is used in designing educational games, the game context is usually arranged in a fixed sequence. However, the designated content may not effectively support the diversity of players. The player’s ability and characteristics should be considered and supported with an appropriate learning context embedded in the game to facilitate personalised experiences. Adapting game scenarios to a player’s characteristics can boost motivation and ultimately improve learning outcomes. This research applies a context-aware design approach and the Learner-Centered Design approach to establish a personalised adaptation framework for designing educational serious games and enhancing personalised knowledge delivery. The proposed framework decouples the game logic implementation and adaptation mechanism. It dynamically adapts the designed game objects and activities to personal learning objectives, learning levels and learning progress to achieve a non-linear learning sequence. Through synchronous real-time {xAPI} message exchange mechanisms, system components and learning content adaptation are enabled. The adaptation aims to fit personal learning objectives and provide a non-linear learning sequence in a game environment. The framework provides students with personalised learning experiences. A game named {GhostCoder} is implemented and used to evaluate the framework. Based on the externalised adaptive mechanism, the game content is adapted to the player’s performance by adjusting the difficulty of the learning content within the game.

	abstract = {The concept of the {ZPD} is characterized in a different way in two separate contexts (school and play) in Vygotsky's cultural historical psychology. Creative and motivational aspect of learning is emphasized in development supported by play. In play context personality development is focused on and development of psychological functions in problem solving at school. We proposed an extended concept of the {ZPD}, which integrates the two definitions and includes an additional distance from potentials to personality changes. In play development from the crisis of the third year to the next crisis at seven we suggest three different types of the {ZPD} depending on the play initiatives.},

	abstract = {Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applicable to different domains such as education, business, and health care. Although the game development process differs from the traditional software development process because it involves interdisciplinary activities. Software engineering techniques are still important for game development because they can help the developer to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},
