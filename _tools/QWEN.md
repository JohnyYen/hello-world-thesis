# Thesis LaTeX Project - QWEN Context

## Project Overview

This is a LaTeX-based thesis project titled **"Arquitectura de software adaptativa para la personalización del aprendizaje mediante videojuegos educativos"** (Adaptive Software Architecture for Learning Personalization Through Educational Games) by Johny A. Pedraza Romero.

This repository contains a complete LaTeX thesis document focused on the design of an adaptive educational platform that incorporates video games to enhance learning personalization. The thesis explores the intersection of educational games, gamification, adaptive learning, and software architecture design.

## Project Structure

- `main.tex`: Main document file that includes all chapters and components
- `package.tex`: LaTeX packages and document configuration settings
- `variables.tex`: Document variables like title, author, and chapter names
- `chapters/`: Directory containing individual thesis chapters:
  - `introduction.tex`: Introduction with research problem and objectives
  - `chapter_one.tex`: Theoretical framework on video games and learning
  - `chapter_two.tex`: Solution design
  - `chapter_three.tex`: Validation of the solution
  - `abstract.tex`: Abstract section
  - `conclusion.tex`: Conclusions
  - `recomendation.tex`: Recommendations
- `bibliography.bib`: Main bibliography file with research references
- `tesis.bib`: Additional bibliography file
- `Diseño de la Solución.bib`: Solution design bibliography
- `main-blx.bib`: Bibliography file generated by biblatex
- `extra/`: Additional elements like portrait page
- `src/`: Directory for images and resources (as specified in package.tex)
- `.devcontainer/`: Development container configuration for consistent environment

## Key Research Areas

The thesis focuses on:
1. Educational games and their role in modern learning
2. Gamification principles in educational contexts
3. Adaptive learning technologies
4. Software architecture for educational platforms
5. Programming education through games

## Development Environment

This project uses a containerized development environment with:
- **Docker**: Using `danteev/texlive` image with TeX Live pre-installed
- **Devcontainer**: Pre-configured environment with LaTeX Workshop and other extensions
- **Node.js**: For additional tooling
- **LaTeX packages**: Biber, biblatex, graphicx, geometry, fancyhdr, and others

The development environment automatically compiles the LaTeX document when saving files and provides spell-checking for Spanish language documents.

## Compilation Process

The project uses standard LaTeX compilation with:
- Biber backend for bibliography processing
- Numeric citation style
- Proper UTF-8 support for Spanish language characters
- Custom headers and page formatting
- Automatic compilation on save in the development container

## LaTeX Document Configuration

- Document class: `report` (12pt, a4paper)
- Language: Spanish (`babel` package)
- Font: Helvetica
- Spacing: One and half spacing
- Bibliography style: Numeric with custom settings
- Page headers with chapter names and page numbers

## Current Status

The thesis appears to be in progress, with:
- A comprehensive introduction that outlines research objectives and methodology
- Chapter 1 (Marco Teórico) well developed with content on video games in education
- Additional chapters referenced but not fully examined in this analysis

## Important Commands for Working with This Project

To build the LaTeX document in the development environment:
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
biber main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

This runs the LaTeX toolchain to properly generate the document with citations and bibliography.

## Key Variables

The thesis is structured around several key variables:
- Independent variable: Development of an educational platform with modules
- Dependent variables: Domain mastery (measured through pre/post tests) and motivation level (measured through platform usage)

## Objectives

The thesis has the following main objectives:
- **General**: Develop an educational platform based on adaptive video game mechanics for teaching programming
- **Specific**: 
  1. Identify conceptual, pedagogical, and psychological foundations of educational video games
  2. Analyze game design methodologies and select the most appropriate one
  3. Design the platform architecture
  4. Validate technical quality and usability of the game
