	abstract = {This current study is a meta-analysis conducted on 63 studies on video-game based cognitive interventions (118 investigations, N = 2,079), which demonstrated a moderate and significant training effect on overall gains in cognition, g = 0.25, p {\textless} .001. Significant evidence of transfer was found to overall cognition, as well as to attention/perception and higher-order cognition constructs. Examination of specific gameplay features however showed selective and differential transfer to these outcome measures, whereas the genre labels of “action”, “strategy”, “casual”, and “non-casual” were not similarly predictive of outcomes. We therefore recommend that future video-game interventions targeting cognitive enhancements should consider gameplay feature classification approach over existing genre classification, which may provide more fruitful training-related benefits to cognition.},

	title = {A Games First Approach to Teaching Introductory Programming},
	abstract = {In this paper we argue for using a “Game First” approach to teaching introductory programming. We believe that concerns over whether an {OO} approach or a procedural approach should be used first are secondary to the course assignment and example content. If examples are not compelling, student interest often lags thus making the {OO} versus procedural argument moot. We believe that game programming motivates most new programmers. Compelling assignments mean that students are far more likely to learn because they are interested, and the visual component allows students to see mistakes in their code as manifested in the resultant graphics. We describe our experiences after redesigning and offering a new introductory computer science sequence using 2D game development as a unifying theme. We teach fundamental programming concepts via two dimensional game development in Flash and {ActionScript} during the first quarter, transition to C++ to solidify concepts and add pointers during the second quarter, then teach a multi-phase project based game approach using C++ and {openGL} (2D graphics only) during the third quarter. Our surveys show that this approach improved student understanding of all seven basic topics examined.},

	abstract = {Problem-based learning ({PBL}) is a didactic strategy oriented to the competency-based approach within constructivist theories. {PBL} generates a collaborative learning process in the student, as well as self-learning and meaningful learning from a contextualized problem situation. This methodology arises to support the process of pedagogical change that occurs under the competency-based approach in higher education in order to generate active learning in students. In this paper, a five-phase methodology was developed (identification of the problem situation, organization of the work for collaborative learning, monitoring and support for self-learning, construction of applied solutions, and evaluations and feedback) to apply {PBL} in the Supply Chain Management course of the Industrial Engineering Program at Corporación Universitaria del Caribe ({CECAR}). A systematic literature review was carried out to identify the low application rate of the methodology in the field of industrial engineering. For the application of the strategy, three contextualized problems were taken as a basis, which are associated with companies of the economic sectors that have the highest influence in the generation of the Gross Domestic Product ({GDP}) of the region. The academic impact on a total of four groups was evaluated. Additionally, the expected competences, performances, and products in the courses were achieved, thus obtaining a great acceptance and efficiency in {PBL} application.},

	abstract = {One of the main barriers for Educational Game ({EG}) to properly fulfill the specific pedagogical, cultural and technical requirements that are often unique to each situation is the difficulty of reusing and adapting them to different educational contexts. In this sense, open {EGs} could facilitate reuse and adaptation, once they follow the openness principles. This paper provides a systematic review of Open Educational Games ({OEG}) designed specifically for teaching computer programming and computational logic. It has been identified that most authors find the issue of reusing and adapting {EGs} following the openness philosophy as very important, but even them fail to use open tools in game development. We conclude that most articles recommend using component-based development, reuse and adaptation, but reuse still does not happen in a practical sense. Also, the amount of studies on {EGs} for teaching programming is low in the scientific literature, and most open {EGs} available on the Internet are not documented nor have some associated published paper. Thus, reuse and adaptation may even occur, but without scientific documentation and publication.},

	abstract = {The idea of Gamification is very popular for applying the gaming concept theory in various fields. Nowhere else is this more important than in education. Considering the careful build-up and implementation of game-elements could improve academic performance outcome and student motivation. However, Gamification could require much more time to be designed and applied to education related activities and it also comes with significant operating and design cost to provide highly engaging activities for students. One of the main problems in designing Gamification is the question: “which game elements should be applied to student activities?”. Moreover one must make sure that it has great impact on students’ performance in terms of their education related performance. Hence, in this research, we focused on studying the impact of each element in order to investigate the behavioral outcome of game elements in educational environments through the concept of knowledge and game-based learning from the Gamification concept. In our experiment, we examined the impact of each game element on senior high school students based on the basic elements of Gamification such as Leaderboard, Cooperative and Awarding badges. In addition, we studied the effect of the game-based learning application called Aqua Republica from {UNEP} and {DHI} centers with partner of Thailand. The experiment design compared two groups: the “Non-Gamified” and the “Gamified” groups participating in the game-based learning activity Aqua Republica. Academic indicators and numerical indicators were used to directly measure the effect and behavioral outcome of the use of game elements. Finally, the study suggested that leaderboards could improve the overall performance of students so it can be worth implementing it in classroom activities.},

	abstract = {The article features the analysis of game development software tools in higher educational institutions of Ukraine (Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State Pedagogical University), Turkey (Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University) and Bulgaria (Trakia University). The article highlights the results of the research conducted by teachers and students of these universities. In this research, teachers with no previous experience in this field or specialized {IT} skills created educational games. Free software tools that can be used to create educational games were selected for this research (Construct 3, {GameMaker} Studio 2, Unity, Godot Engine, Unreal Engine 4). The study included two data arrays: the first was the opinion expressed by teachers who developed educational games, and the second – that of students who tested the final game product. We analyzed free tools for creating educational games according to such criteria: the need for programming language knowledge, availability of support forums and reference materials, ability to export data to multiple platforms and in many formats, add in-app purchases or various components to each object, whether both 2D and 3D games are supported, development speed. In the Ukrainian teachers’ opinion, {GameMaker} Studio 2 was the most effective, while teachers in Turkey and Bulgaria preferred the Unreal Engine 4. According to research results, it is worth noting a high interest of both teachers and students in the creation and use of educational computer games. It should also be noted that these results are relevant only for specific groups under study since they are based on the individual experience of a limited number of students. However, they are significant for shaping ideas about pedagogical strategies and allow teachers to learn new information, try new types of activities and interaction.},

Methodologically, a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) was developed under the {PRISMA} statement criteria using three multidisciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and Scielo. According to the inclusion, exclusion, and quality criteria, it was determined to include 9 {SLR} articles on gamification that address at least one of the two key variables: student motivation or academic performance. The articles were published between 2016 and 2022, available in open access, written in English or Spanish, and with content that is directly related to the research questions. The results reveal that gamification significantly influences motivation by facilitating the assimilation of knowledge, the improvement of skills and academic competencies of students, and specifically refers to a wide range of capabilities that are essential for success in the educational environment and that can be enhanced through playful and interactive learning experiences. These skills can be cognitive, self-learning, social, or collaborative, among others. It is concluded that creativity and adaptability are key to successfully implementing gamification in the classroom.},

During last two decades, video games proved to be an interactive visual media able to incorporate virtual heritage in amazing and highly appealing ways. At the same time, each video game represents a valuable artifact reflecting technological, socioeconomic and historical issues of its creation. Therefore, video games are an essential and integrated part of modern cultural heritage and themselves need preservation efforts. The present paper discusses video games as a modern tool for presenting cultural heritage by integrating art, storytelling and digital technology. It focuses on both entertainment games and serious games for cultural heritage and provides some illustrative examples of such games with discussing their approach and novelty. On the other hand, video games are viewed as interactive artifacts that are a valuable part of the modern cultural heritage, which requires specific efforts for their preservation together with technological platforms and gaming environment.},

Programming is considered a challenging subject by students and teachers, consequently students feel less motivated to learn it. It is important to know how educational games can help to enhance our student’s motivation and learning perceptions towards Programming. This paper discusses the authors’ pilot study of undergraduate students’ perceptions towards using educational games as their learning medium using five constructs: motivation, attitudes, cognitive development, interface and expectation with 24 items. The findings indicated that most students had encouraging positive attitudes and were more motivated to learn Programming using games compared to conventional methods. The findings are hopefully will help to enrich knowledge in understanding students’ perceptions regarding educational games for learning, particularly in the Malaysian context.},

This permeability allows the study of the cultural aspects surrounding the production and use of video games as tools for cultural dissemination. Our research enunciates, recognises, analyses and evaluates the impact of these tools with the aim of being taken into consideration by the scientiﬁc community and the general population, who most frequently consume, use and socialise through video games around the world. Based on this, a systematic literature review ({SLR}) was carried out using the Prisma 2020 Protocol, using the {WOS} and {SCOPUS} databases as documentary sources, and the selection of research articles that explore the cultural aspects of video games according to pre-established criteria. The ﬁnal sample (N = 45) was subjected to a study that posed 12 research questions around which this work is structured. As a result, it is evident that video games have a direct impact on the transmission of culture. Patterns and agents of cultural representation, transmission and communication were identiﬁed, allowing researchers to evaluate the impact of video games on culture and to approach this object of study from an academic perspective, helping to open up other lines of research related to the inﬂuence of video games on the assimilation of culture, the learning of relevant issues related to it or the transmission of speciﬁc cultural elements.},

Nevertheless, despite an increasing academic interest in {EVGs} little research has been devoted to delve into teacher’s beliefs affecting their attitude towards {EVGs} and how these beliefs also affect their intention to use {EVGs} in their courses. Using Keller’s {ARCS} model as a theoretical framework, the role of perceived relevance and attention in teachers’ attitude and intention to use {EVGs} is analyzed. To do so a research model is tested using a sample of 312 Higher Education teachers via structural equation modeling to predict teachers’ attitude and behavioral intention to use {EVGs} in their courses. Results suggest that perceived attention drawn by {EVGs} is a factor affecting teachers’ intentions to use {EVGs} in their courses. Perceived relevance was not found to affect directly neither attitude nor intention to use while teachers’ perceived attention was found to affect teachers’ perceived relevance of {EVGs}. Limitations of the study, implications for managers, and future research lines are addressed at the end of the paper.},

To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify i) which gamification design methods have been used in the studies about gamification and Flow Theory, ii) which gamification elements have been used in these studies, iii) which methods have been used to evaluate the users’ flow experience in gamified settings, and iv) how gamification affects users’ flow experience. The main results show that there is growing interest to this field, as the number of publications is increasing. The most significant interest is in the area of gamification in education. However, there is no unanimity regarding the preferred method of the study or the effects of gamification on users’ experience.

	abstract = {The new society of knowledge and technology has created a new map in which young people feel concerns which education has not always been able to satisfy. This new scenario has changed the interests of students. Therefore, teachers need to explore new strategies and resources to increase the motivation and engagement of the students. The aim of this paper is to review the benefits of the use of gamification and its application in education. Several academic publications between 2011 and 2016 regarding to the use of gamification, motivation and immersion, have been examined. The choice of this period of time has been made in order to offer a review of the evolution and development of gamification during those five years. According to Werbach and Hunter (2012), it is necessary to study the game dynamics, mechanics and components under a qualitative methodology based on the analysis of the content. Results show that gamification processes in education generate important benefits to the students, not without some difficulties. The article concludes in support of the benefits of the use of gamification in education, such as motivation, immersion in order to plan new situations and anticipate them, the engagement and the sociability through interaction and interactivity, as well as the great number of different elements involved in the process, which make education more motivating and engaging for students.},

It has recently become widely known and is an approach that is being used in many fields. This article intends to identify and map trends and patterns in gamification research. For this purpose, this article employs a systematic review in which document and content analysis were used. Research findings have revealed that conceptual/descriptive papers outweigh other type of papers; however, quantitative and qualitative papers are showing an increasing trend. Lexical analysis demonstrated that education, teaching, and learning; engagement, motivation, and behavior change, and gamified designs, are emerging concepts. Keyword analysis revealed that gamification, engagement, and motivation are most frequently used keywords. Gamification articles are mostly related to the education field. Self-Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and {MDA} (Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetic) Framework appeared to be the most beneficial lenses in gamification studies.},

Teaching programming is mainly focused on the syntax and features of programs, rather than to a deeper understanding of programming constructs and abstract concepts. Computer game stimulates active learning and presentation of learning content in a variety of contexts that are funny and engaging for students. This has a positive impact on the motivation to learn. This paper deals mainly with defining the programming knowledge and common problems with teaching programming, comparing the properties of novice and experts programmers and introducing the semantic method of teaching programming where one would teach only the semantics of programming constructs unbound to specific programming language in an interactive motivating setting of educational computer game. In this paper we discuss the main characteristics of computer games and specific features which makes them useful in the educational setting. As an example of presented method we introduce a game on the presentation of variables in programming. The game is based on visualizations of different types of variables and on the interpretation of the assignment sentence. The game actively encourages interactivity and deeper learning.},

The view of constructivism shall be taken as an agent-based view for act based theoretical approaches did not have much success in tackling the morality of a player. Constructivism that is being taken into the account is a procedure of moral reasoning derived from the theories of John Rawls and Thomas Scanlon. The strategy of this argument will be to expand on the paper written by Eric Sheng in which he stresses his concerns on the immoral playthrough of the player. This expansion of Sheng’s argument will shed light on the different ways in which we play video games and that the same acts do not have to have the same moral problems. Therefore, the constructivist procedure will be used as a way to determine an answer to the question of the individual motivation behind a virtual act and show the moral implications of it. At the end of the paper, the weaknesses and the benefits of this approach shall be stressed.},

Alas, there is no consensus at this point as to what the research output in design science is and what types of artifacts exist. Using a widely accepted artifact typology would strengthen the scientific discussion and ease the categorization of contributions. Based on a literature review of all {DESRIST} publications and a special {MISQ} issue on design science, we derived such a typology. We identified eight relevant artifact types and related our typology to existing ones. With this contribution, we hope to enable a discussion about what legitimate design science outputs and their main types are.},

Further, the study wanted to explore student perceptions of Prodigy. The study was conducted in two fifth grade classrooms with a total of 31 participants. Two mathematics units were utilized to compare; one on multiplying whole numbers and the other on dividing whole numbers. In addition, participants completed a survey and a focus group interview to find out participant perceptions of Prodigy. Results reveal that the whole group scored higher in Prodigy (M=9.581, {SD}=4.048) compared to no Prodigy (M=5.419, {SD}=3.871). Similar results were reported in each of the subgroups. The same results were reported for each of the subgroups. The scores for Prodigy program are higher than no Prodigy. For the survey, participants showed an overall as well as within each subgroup positive view of Prodigy, with 112 Agree and Strongly Agree responses compared to 9 Disagree and Strongly Disagree responses. Almost all subgroups, especially by ethnicity, reported that they like and feel the Prodigy program helped them learn math better and enjoy using it in class. However, the male subgroup feels the Prodigy program is less interesting.},

	abstract = {When the traditional "one size fits all" approach is used in designing educational games, the game context is usually arranged in a fixed sequence. However, the designated content may not effectively support the diversity of players. The player’s ability and characteristics should be considered and supported with an appropriate learning context embedded in the game to facilitate personalised experiences. Adapting game scenarios to a player’s characteristics can boost motivation and ultimately improve learning outcomes. This research applies a context-aware design approach and the Learner-Centered Design approach to establish a personalised adaptation framework for designing educational serious games and enhancing personalised knowledge delivery. The proposed framework decouples the game logic implementation and adaptation mechanism. It dynamically adapts the designed game objects and activities to personal learning objectives, learning levels and learning progress to achieve a non-linear learning sequence. Through synchronous real-time {xAPI} message exchange mechanisms, system components and learning content adaptation are enabled. The adaptation aims to fit personal learning objectives and provide a non-linear learning sequence in a game environment. The framework provides students with personalised learning experiences. A game named {GhostCoder} is implemented and used to evaluate the framework. Based on the externalised adaptive mechanism, the game content is adapted to the player’s performance by adjusting the difficulty of the learning content within the game. Testing of the game in the lab environment has been performed. At the next stage, an evaluation will be conducted with the target groups of students.},

Although the game development process differs from the traditional software development process because it involves interdisciplinary activities. Software engineering techniques are still important for game development because they can help the developer to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},
